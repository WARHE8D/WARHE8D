# Hi, I'm Murtuza!

**Senior Software Engineer | AI & Machine Learning Enthusiast | ITX Aficionado**

I’m a full-stack developer who loves the challenge of squeezing maximum performance out of every line of code—much like trying to fit a 7600XT into a ITX case. With 4+ years of experience across Java, Spring Boot, React, and AI, I build enterprise-grade applications that are as scalable as they are efficient.

### 🛠 What I’m Working On
* **Full-Stack Excellence:** Deep-diving into classic Design Patterns to architect more resilient, high-availability backend systems using Java and Azure Cosmos DB.
* **AI/ML Innovation:** From training reinforcement learning models for **AWS DeepRacer** (1st place champ! 🏆) to deploying NLP pipelines.
* **Optimization:** Whether it's migrating legacy code for a 40% performance boost or optimizing SQL queries, I live for the "refactor."

### 🕹 Beyond the Code
* **SFF PC Building:** I’m a sucker for ITX builds—if it’s compact and high-performance, I’m in. I recently crossed a major milestone by finally completing my **dream PC build**.
* **Gaming & Anime:** Love getting lost in immersive worlds and masterclass storytelling. Big fan of the classics like **Steins;Gate** and modern hits like **86**.

I’m always down to talk about Java architecture, AI model deployments, or the best airflow setup for a FormD T1.
