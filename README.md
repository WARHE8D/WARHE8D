# Hi, I'm Murtuza!

I'm a full-stack developer, AI enthusiast. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can probably find me gaming or watching someone build an ITX PC. My passion lies in creating compact, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

## About Me:
- **Background**: I have a degree in Computer Science and a graduate certificate in AI with Machine Learning.
- **Experience**: I've worked as a full-stack developer, building Java-based applications, developing APIs, and optimizing system performance. I also enjoy diving into AI projects, particularly reinforcement learning and NLP.
- **What Iâ€™m up to**: Currently studying Object-Oriented Software Development at SAIT while balancing my love for tech and gaming.

## Skills:
- Full Stack Development (Java, JavaScript, C#)
- AI/ML (TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn)
- Cloud & DevOps (AWS, Docker)
- Database Management (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Feel free to check out my work! When I'm not immersed in code, I'm probably watching anime or some gaming PC builds. ðŸ˜„ Letâ€™s connect!
